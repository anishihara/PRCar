# ----------
# User Instructions:
# 
# Create a function compute_value() which returns
# a grid of values. Value is defined as the minimum
# number of moves required to get from a cell to the
# goal. 
#
# If it is impossible to reach the goal from a cell
# you should assign that cell a value of 99.
